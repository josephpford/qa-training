# Lesson: Introduction to Quality Engineering

## Goals of the Quality Engineering Module

Quality Engineering is an evolving, vast domain. In this module we will explore 3 main concepts
 - Test Management, Manual Testing and Defects
 - Automation Testing
 - Performance Testing

Over the next 3 days we will explore these quality topics by testing a 100% complete Field Agent. We will start with Manual Testing, then move to Automated Testing, and wrap up with Performance Testing. Each day will begin with a small amount of lecture, some reading, and then hands-on exercises.

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Quality Engineering

In this lesson, we will introduce many high level concepts used within the Quality and Software Engineering industries. First we will talk about defects, understand what they are, how much they cost and how we discover them. Then we will discuss 3 related but different terms in the industry "Quality Assurance", "Quality Management" and "Quality Engineering". 

## Learning Outcomes

When you've finished this lesson, you should be able to:
* Explain what defects are and why a focus on Quality can reduce the overall cost of developing software
* Articulate the differences between Quality Assurance, Quality Management, Quality Engineering
* Summarize 2 Software Development Methodologies and understand how Quality Engineering fits into both methodologies
  - Waterfall
  - Agile
* Understand different test levels (System Testing, Integration Testing, etc.)
