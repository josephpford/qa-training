# Module 15 Overview

## Goal
Deliver 1 week of Security and Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) training to Dev10 trainees. Provide an awareness of Security and Quality Management practices, tools, and concepts and apply some of the learnings by securing and testing a sample application.

## Assessment

- Provide Students with Application to be Secured and Tested
- Implement User Authentication Using OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- Create Manual Test Cases
- Create Defects
- Create Automated Test Cases
- Create Performance Test Script
- Assess trainees' understanding of Quality Management topics

## Approach

- Mornings: Introduce concepts to trainees
- Afternoons: Apply new concepts by creating the following for a sample application
  - Implement OpenID Connect (OIDC)
  - Create Manual Test Cases
  - Automate Test Cases using Java / JUnit / Selenium
  - Create Performance Test scripts using Apache JMeter and drive with CSV
