# Quality Engineering Training

## Goal
Provide an awareness of Quality Engineer in Test practices, tools, and concepts and apply some of the learnings by testing a sample application.

## Assessment

- Provide Students with Application to be Tested
- Create Manual Test Cases
- Create Defects
- Create Automated Test Cases
- Create Performance Test Script
- Assess trainees' understanding of Quality Management topics

## Approach

- Mornings: Introduce concepts to trainees
- Afternoons: Apply new concepts by creating the following for a sample application
  - Create Manual Test Cases
  - Automate Test Cases using Java / JUnit / Selenium
  - Create Performance Test scripts using Apache JMeter and drive with CSV
