## Quality Assurance vs Quality Management vs Quality Engineering

### Good: Quality Assurance (QA)

Quality Assurance (QA) specifically deals with testing and finding defects. QA is reactive. QA is the practice of testing software against documented requirements. It is the process of using a product and checking to see if it works as expected according to the documented requirements. 

If we think of soccer, defects are like goals scored against your team. And a professional sports team may spend a lot of money to hire a fantastic goalie to prevent goals. QA Professionals are like soccer goalies. They test and report defects to prevent them from being released to customers.

QA is testing. Some QA concepts that we will dive into more include
- Test Plans
- Test Cases and Test Runs
  - Manual Testing
  - Automated Testing
- Defects / Bugs
- Requirement Traceability Matrices
- Testing Types
  - Functional Testing 
  - Regression Testing 
  - System Testing 
  - etc.

### Better: Quality Management (QM)

Quality Management (QM) is the practice of recommending policies and procedures with the goal of increasing overall product quality, not just reducing defects. QM recognizes that defects cost a lot of money if they were found during the testing cycle of a project and recommend changes to the development team's processes to increase product quality, which ultimately reduces the cost and the amount of defects. QM is proactive. QM seeks to avoid the defects from ever existing in the first place by performing [root cause analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis).

Back to our soccer analogy, QM is like hiring an Assistant Coach with a defensive mindset. That Assistant Coach will coach not just the Goalie, but also the rest of the team. Perhaps they will recommend different formations that increase the teams defense. 

Some topics in QM include
- Quality "Consulting"
- Requirements Analysis
- Test Data Management
- Defect Root Cause Analysis

### Best: Quality Engineering (QE)

Quality Engineering (QE) builds on the practice of QM by getting everyone on the team involved, with everyone doing their part to ensure a quality product. QE is a blurring of the lines between QA/QM and Engineering. It is introducing testing earlier in the development lifecycle, and incorporating functional test automation into the build pipeline. It is an entire soccer team agreeing that "Offense Wins Games But Defense Wins Championships". Some of the topics in QE are:
- DevOps
- Automated Tests built into the process rather than as an after-thought
- Blending of roles between Quality Assurance Engineer and Software Development Engineer
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery
- Code Coverage
- Static Code Analysis
- Pair Programming
- Code Reviews
