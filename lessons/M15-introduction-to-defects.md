# Introduction to Defects

Defects are deviations from expected behavior. If the product is supposed to be red, but it's blue, that's a defect. If the email address is supposed to be validated for correctness, but there is no validation pop-up to the user when they enter an invalid email address, that is a defect. If the system is supposed to be able to respond within 25ms, but it responds in 35ms, that is a defect. The way defects are discovered are many, but typically occurs during some form of "testing". Worst case, they are discovered by customers!

There are lots of studies and articles that show defects found early in the software development lifecycle cost less than defects found later in the software development lifecycle.
